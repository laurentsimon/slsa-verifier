# Verification of SLSA provenance
This repository contains an implementation for verifying [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/). It currently supports verifying provenance generated by the [SLSA generator for Go projects](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator-go). In the future, this will also verify provenance for other ecosystems and systems.

## Verification of Provenance

### Available options

Below is a lit of options currently supported. Note that signature verification is handled seamlessly without the need for developers to manipulate public keys.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:slsa-framework/slsa-verifier.git
$ go run . --help
    -binary string
    	path to a binary to verify
    -provenance string
    	path to a provenance file
    -source string
        expected source repository that should have produced the binary, e.g. github.com/org/example
    -tag string
       expected tag the build was generated for
    -versioned-tag string
       expected version the build was generated for. Uses semenatic version to match the tag
    -branch
      expected branch the build was generated from       
```

### Example

```bash
$ go run . --binary ~/Downloads/binary-linux-amd64 --provenance ~/Downloads/binary-linux-amd64.intoto.jsonl --source github.com/origin/repo
